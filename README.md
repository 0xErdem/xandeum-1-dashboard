## ⚡ The Problem vs. Our Solution

**The Problem:** Traditional validator dashboards are often cluttered lists or simple spreadsheets. They show raw data but lack context. It is difficult for a user to instantly spot a failing node or understand the overall health of the network in a single glance.

**The Xandeum.OS Solution:** We treat the network as a living organism, focusing on **visual density** and **interpreted data**.
1.  **XRI (Xandeum Reliability Index):** Instead of just showing uptime, we calculate a weighted score based on *Vote Lag*, *Block Skip Rate*, and *Efficiency*.
2.  **Visual Matrix:** We replaced pagination with a high-density "Health Matrix" that visualizes the entire cluster status in a single view.
3.  **Client Diversity:** We actively track software versions to help prevent single-point-of-failure risks during network upgrades.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🛡️ The XRI Algorithm
A custom scoring engine (0-100) that rates node reliability in real-time.
- **Gold Badge (90+):** Elite performance.
- **Silver Badge (75+):** Reliable operation.
- **Bronze Badge (50+):** Standard operation.
- **Risk (<50):** Immediate attention required.

### 2. 👁️ Monitor Mode (NOC View)
Designed for Network Operations Centers.
- **Adaptive Matrix Grid:** Automatically switches between "Detail Cards" (for small networks) and "Status Dots" (for large networks) to maximize screen real estate.
- **Live Feed:** Real-time scrolling log of network events.
- **Instant Filtering:** One-click filter to isolate "Critical" or "Warning" nodes instantly.

### 3. 📊 Analyst Mode (Deep Dive)
Designed for Researchers and Stakers.
- **Historical Data:** Tracks TPS and Stake trends over time (powered by Supabase time-series data).
- **Client Diversity:** Visualizes the distribution of node software versions to ensure network decentralization.
- **Deep Linking:** Share specific node details via URL parameters (`?node=PUBKEY`).
- **CSV Export:** Download filtered datasets for offline analysis.

### 4. ⭐ My Nodes (Personalization)
- **Watchlist:** Star your favorite nodes to create a personalized command center.
- **Alert Simulation:** Interface for setting up email/telegram alerts for XRI drops.
- **Local Persistence:** Your watchlist is saved locally on your device, respecting privacy.

## 🏗️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/0xErdem/xandeum-1-dashboard.git](https://github.com/0xErdem/xandeum-1-dashboard.git)
    cd xandeum-1-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials (required for historical charts):
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    ```

4.  **Run Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 📊 Database Schema (Supabase)

To enable the historical TPS chart, create the following table in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create the stats table
create table public.network_stats (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  time timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  stake numeric,
  tps numeric,
  node_count integer,
  epoch integer
);

-- Enable Security
alter table public.network_stats enable row level security;

-- Policies
create policy "Public Read" on public.network_stats for select using (true);
create policy "Public Insert" on public.network_stats for insert with check (true);
